## python graph demo about Human biorhythms

Human biorhythms are a theory that suggests that there are three cycles that govern our physical, emotional, and intellectual well-being. These cycles are said to be approximately 23, 28, and 33 days long, respectively.

The Three Cycles:

Physical Cycle (23 days): This cycle is thought to influence our energy levels, stamina, and physical performance. When this cycle is high, we feel more energetic and resilient. When it's low, we may feel tired and more susceptible to illness.

Emotional Cycle (28 days): This cycle is believed to affect our mood, emotions, and sensitivity. During the high points of this cycle, we tend to feel more optimistic, happy, and emotionally stable. During the lows, we may experience mood swings, irritability, and increased sensitivity.

Intellectual Cycle (33 days): This cycle is thought to influence our mental clarity, focus, and creativity. When this cycle is high, we may find it easier to concentrate, learn new things, and come up with creative ideas. When it's low, we may experience mental fog, difficulty concentrating, and a lack of motivation.
